# koralyte

An elegant, minimalist Hugo theme for creating clean websites and blogs.

This theme was visually inspired by the Blowfish Hugo theme, which is itself a fork of Congo. I migrated off of Blowfish
as concerns rose over its broken functionality, declining code quality, and questionable content practices.

The aim of Koralyte is to be significantly simpler, with a stronger focus on clean code and maintainability.

I will likely not be able to focus on this until at least mid-2025.
